This project involves automating the deployment and configuration of a multi-tier web application using Ansible across different environments: Development, Staging, and Production. Here's a structured approach for achieving the goals of the project.

Step 1: GitHub Repository Setup
Create a GitHub Repository:

Name the repository, for example, ansible-multi-tier-app-configuration.
Set up the repository with the following directory structure:
r
Copy
ansible-multi-tier-app-configuration/
├── README.md
├── inventories/
│   ├── dev/
│   ├── staging/
│   └── prod/
├── playbooks/
│   ├── nginx.yml
│   ├── app_servers.yml
│   └── mysql.yml
├── roles/
│   ├── nginx/
│   ├── app_server/
│   └── mysql/
├── group_vars/
│   ├── dev/
│   ├── staging/
│   └── prod/
└── host_vars/
    ├── dev/
    ├── staging/
    └── prod/
Create a README.md:

Describe the repository, its structure, and how to use it.
Add instructions on how to run playbooks and configure environments.
Step 2: Environment-Specific Configuration
Inventory Files: Create inventories for each environment (Development, Staging, Production) in the inventories directory. Example for dev:

csharp
Copy
[load_balancers]
lb1 ansible_host=192.168.1.10

[app_servers]
app1 ansible_host=192.168.1.11
app2 ansible_host=192.168.1.12

[db_servers]
db1 ansible_host=192.168.1.20
Group Vars and Host Vars:

Use group_vars and host_vars for environment-specific configurations such as database credentials and IP addresses. For example, in group_vars/dev/db.yml:
yaml
Copy
db_user: devuser
db_password: devpassword
db_name: devdb
db_host: 192.168.1.20
Roles for Common Tasks:

Create reusable roles under roles/ to set up Nginx, app servers, and MySQL. Each role should have tasks for installing and configuring the components.
Step 3: Playbook Development
Nginx Playbook (load_balancer.yml): Create a playbook to install and configure Nginx as a load balancer:

yaml
Copy
---
- name: Setup Nginx as load balancer
  hosts: load_balancers
  become: true
  roles:
    - nginx
App Server Playbook (app_servers.yml): Create a playbook to set up the application server with Python and the web app:

yaml
Copy
---
- name: Configure Application Servers
  hosts: app_servers
  become: true
  roles:
    - app_server
MySQL Playbook (mysql.yml): Create a playbook to configure the MySQL database server:

yaml
Copy
---
- name: Setup MySQL Server
  hosts: db_servers
  become: true
  roles:
    - mysql
Step 4: Trigger Configuration Changes
GitHub Actions Setup:
Set up a GitHub Action that triggers playbook execution when changes are pushed. Example github-actions.yml:
yaml
Copy
name: Ansible Playbook Deployment

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Set up Ansible
        uses: devops-infra/action-ansible@v2
        
      - name: Run Ansible playbook
        run: |
          ansible-playbook -i inventories/dev/ansible_hosts playbooks/nginx.yml
          ansible-playbook -i inventories/dev/ansible_hosts playbooks/app_servers.yml
          ansible-playbook -i inventories/dev/ansible_hosts playbooks/mysql.yml
Step 5: Error Handling
Error Handling in Ansible: Add retries and rollback mechanisms to sensitive tasks:

yaml
Copy
- name: Ensure MySQL is running
  service:
    name: mysql
    state: started
    enabled: true
  retries: 3
  delay: 10
  register: mysql_status
  until: mysql_status.state == "started"
Rollback Mechanism: Use Ansible's block and rescue for rollback:

yaml
Copy
tasks:
  - block:
      - name: Create MySQL user
        mysql_user:
          name: "{{ db_user }}"
          password: "{{ db_password }}"
          priv: "*.*:ALL"
          state: present
    rescue:
      - name: Rollback - Remove MySQL user
        mysql_user:
          name: "{{ db_user }}"
          state: absent
Step 6: Notifications
Slack Notification Setup: Use slack_notify Ansible module to send Slack notifications:

yaml
Copy
- name: Send success notification to Slack
  slack_notify:
    token: "{{ slack_token }}"
    channel: "#deployments"
    text: "Deployment successful for environment {{ ansible_hostname }}"
Email Notifications: Use Ansible’s mail module to send email notifications:

yaml
Copy
- name: Send failure email
  mail:
    to: "devops@example.com"
    subject: "Deployment failed"
    body: "An error occurred during the deployment of the {{ environment }} environment."
  when: deployment_failed
Step 7: Testing and Validation
Test Playbooks:

Validate the playbooks in the dev environment first, ensuring Nginx, app servers, and MySQL are set up correctly.
Automation:

Push changes to the GitHub repository and verify that GitHub Actions triggers the deployment automatically.
Validate Environment-Specific Configurations:

Confirm that each environment gets the correct configurations, such as database credentials and IP addresses, by checking the Ansible execution logs.
